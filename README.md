This study explores the effectiveness of deep learning models, specifically a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a hybrid model that combines CNN with Transformer blocks, in detecting AI-generated fake faces and manually manipulated images. The study achieved a test accuracy of 78.48% with the standard CNN and 76.33% with the hybrid model. Although the hybrid model's performance is slightly below that of the standard CNN, it shows significant promise for future development, particularly in handling complex, real-world scenarios where data is less controlled. The results underscore the potential of hybrid models in enhancing fake face detection, with further refinement needed to improve robustness and accuracy in diverse environments. The study also highlights the importance of integrating these detection systems into everyday tools, such as web browsers, to provide real-time alerts for AI-generated content, emphasizing the need for continued research and innovation in this critical area.
